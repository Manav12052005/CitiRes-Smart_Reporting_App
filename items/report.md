# G0 - 20 Report

The following is a report template to help your team successfully provide all the details necessary for your report in a structured and organised manner. Please give a straightforward and concise report that best demonstrates your project. Note that a good report will give a better impression of your project to the reviewers.

Note that you should have removed ALL TEMPLATE/INSTRUCTION textes in your submission (like the current sentence), otherwise it hampers the professionality in your documentation.

*Here are some tips to write a good report:*

* `Bullet points` are allowed and strongly encouraged for this report. Try to summarise and list the highlights of your project (rather than give long paragraphs).*

* *Try to create `diagrams` for parts that could greatly benefit from it.*

* *Try to make your report `well structured`, which is easier for the reviewers to capture the necessary information.*

*We give instructions enclosed in square brackets [...] and examples for each sections to demonstrate what are expected for your project report. Note that they only provide part of the skeleton and your description should be more content-rich. Quick references about markdown by [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/)*

## Application Description

*[What is your application, what does it do? Include photos or diagrams if necessary]*

*Here is a pet specific application example*

*PetBook is a social media application specifically targetting pet owners... it provides... certified practitioners, such as veterians are indicated by a label next to their profile...*

### Problem Statement

*[Problem statement that defines the purpose of your App]*


### Application Use Cases and/or Examples

Citizen Reporting
Target Users: The target users for this app are the citizens of a city. Below are a few example cases for the use of the application.

    Scenario 1: Reporting a Pothole
    User: City Resident (e.g., John)
    Precondition: John is driving and encounters a pothole on the road.
    Action:John opens the app on his mobile device. He selects "Add Report" and chooses the "Infrastructure" category. The GPS feature auto-captures his current location. He adds additional details about the pothole and submits the report.
    UI Feedback: A toast message displays: "Report Submitted Successfully!" confirming the action.
    Outcome: The pothole is logged, and the cityâ€™s infrastructure department is notified.

    Scenario 2: Deleting a Report
    User: City Resident (e.g., Sarah)
    Precondition: Sarah has previously submitted a report that she now wants to remove because the issue has been resolved.
    Action: Sarah opens the app and navigates to her submitted reports. She selects the report that she wants to delete. Sarah taps the "Delete Report" button. A confirmation dialog appears, asking if she is sure she wants to delete the report. Sarah confirms the deletion.
    UI Feedback: A toast message displays: "Report deleted successfully."
    Outcome: The selected report is removed from the app's database and no longer appears in any report listings.
    Postcondition: The report is permanently deleted from the system, and any linked data (e.g., charts, statistics) is updated to reflect the removal.

    Scenario 3: Scheduling a Report Deletion
    User: City Resident (e.g., John)
    Precondition: John has submitted a report but knows the issue will be resolved in the future and prefers to schedule the deletion in advance.
    Action: John opens the app and navigates to his list of submitted reports. He selects the report that he wants to delete at a future date. John chooses the "Schedule Delete" option and selects a future date and time when the report should be deleted. The app confirms that the deletion is scheduled.
    UI Feedback: A toast message displays: "Report deleted successfully" when the report is deleted.
    Outcome: The app will automatically delete the report at the specified time.
    Postcondition: The report will be deleted at the scheduled time, and the app will update all related data and statistics to reflect the deletion.

A basic User Diagram to explain the process is provided in the items also. Here is the link (https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/e5bf70848fb0433634cda4cf32be9ae96607ed18/items/UserDiagram.png)

## Code Design and Decisions

This is an important section of your report and should include all technical decisions made. Well-written justifications will increase your marks for both the report as well as for the relevant parts (e.g., data structure). This includes, for example,

- Details about the parser (describe the formal grammar and language used)

- Decisions made (e.g., explain why you chose one or another data structure, why you used a specific data model, etc.)

- Details about the design patterns used (where in the code, justification of the choice, etc)


*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design.

<hr>

### Data Structures

*[What data structures did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

Here is a partial (short) example for the subsection `Data Structures`:*

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. **AVLTree**
    - **Objective:**  
      Used for storing and managing citizen reports efficiently.

    - **Code Locations:**  
      Defined in the `AVLTree` class within the `com.example.prototype` package. The AVLTree is utilized in the `DataHolder` class to store, retrieve, and manage reports.

    - **Reasons:**
        - **Efficiency:**  
          AVLTree ensures that insertion, deletion, and search operations are performed in O(log n) time complexity, which is more efficient than using linear data structures like `ArrayList` for large datasets.
        - **Balanced Structure:**  
          Maintains a balanced tree automatically after each operation,
          more efficient than linear-structure data structure.
        - **Sorted Data:**  
          Keeps the reports sorted based on their `reportId`, facilitating quick retrieval and organized data management.
        - **Dynamic Size:**  
          The tree can dynamically adjust its size as reports are added or removed, providing flexibility in handling varying amounts of data.
        - **Easy implementation:**
          AVLTree data structure is more easy to implement in terms of their operations than red-black tree and B-tree.

2. **Tokenizer**
    - **Objective:**  
      Used for parsing and processing user input in the `SearchView` to facilitate effective search functionality.

    - **Code Locations:**  
      Defined in the `Tokenizer` class within the `com.example.prototype` package. It is utilized in the `Parser` class to tokenize and normalize search queries before processing.

    - **Reasons:**
        - **Efficient Parsing:**  
          Breaks down complex search queries into manageable tokens, enabling more precise and relevant search results.
        - **Normalization:**  
          Converts input to lowercase and removes non-word characters except ":" to ensure consistency in search processing, reducing the likelihood of mismatches due to case sensitivity or unwanted characters.
        - **Streamlined Processing:**  
          Utilizes Java Streams and regular expressions for efficient tokenization and filtering of input, enhancing performance for real-time search features.
        - **Modularity:**  
          Encapsulates tokenization logic within a separate class, improving code readability, maintainability, and reusability across different components of the app.

3. **ArrayList**
    - **Objective:**  
      Used for storing lists of reports during tree traversal and for passing data to adapters for UI components.

    - **Code Locations:**  
      Utilized in methods such as `fromLargeToSmall()` and `fromSmallToLarge()` in the `AVLTree` class to store and return ordered lists of reports.

    - **Reasons:**
        - **Dynamic Resizing:**  
          Allows for dynamic addition and removal of elements without predefined size constraints.
        - **Random Access:**  
          Provides quick access to elements by index, which is useful for displaying reports in the UI.
        - **Integration with Adapters:**  
          Compatible with Android's `ListView` adapter, making it suitable for displaying reports in the app's user interface.
<hr>

### Design Patterns
*[What design patterns did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

1. Singleton Pattern
   * *Objective: Assures that a class is produced just once and offers a global point of access to that one instance.*
   * Code Locations: Class Authenticator: Throughout the app's lifetime, just one instance of Authenticator is produced thanks to the getInstance() method.
   * *Reasons:When we desire a single source of truth for the authentication logic used throughout the application, such as with Authenticator, we use singletons to govern the creation of objects.*

   * *Code Locations: Class DataHolder: Here, the singleton design pattern is used to maintain a single instance of the AVL tree throughout the program.*
   * *Reasons: Here,The Singleton pattern ensures that report instances are loaded into the AVL tree only once, maintaining consistent access and avoiding duplication throughout the application.*

2. Observer Pattern
    * *Objective: Enables an object (subject) to communicate any changes in state to its dependents (observers), usually in a decoupled fashion.*
    * *Code Locations: MainActivity implements Observer interface: This pattern allows MainActivity to observe and respond to data changes or events, such as when a report is added or removed, or when sorting is updated, from other activities.*
    * *Reasons:The observer design helps to maintain the user interface current with modifications to the data (e.g., when report data changes in MainActivity).*
  3. Factory Pattern
     *is developped as a surprise feature.*

### Parser and Grammar
#### Grammar Design
There are two main types of grammars in this implementation:
1. Key-Value Grammar: Identifies tokens in the form of key-value pairs, where the key represents an attribute (e.g., description, location, priority) and the value is the filter criterion. This allows users to specify precise filters for specific attributes.
   "KeyValueToken = key : value"  
   example: "location:Main St", "priority:high"
2. General Token Grammar: Represents general search terms that apply to any attribute of the reports. These are useful for broad searches where the user is looking for a term that could appear in multiple fields.
   "GeneralToken = word" 
   example: "Noise", "Broken"
### Tokenizer
The tokenizer breaks the user input into discrete tokens, identifying both key-value pairs and general tokens. It ensures that the input is standardized by removing special characters and splitting the input based on spaces.
1. input Cleaning: Removes non-word characters (excluding the colon : used in key-value pairs) and converts the input to lower case to ensure consistent processing.
2. Token Generation: Splits the cleaned input by spaces to create a list of tokens.
3. Identification: Distinguishes key-value pairs from general tokens based on the presence of a colon : .
4. Example `"[^\\p{L}\\p{N}:]+"` The regular expression matches one or more characters that are not letters, numbers, or colons (:).
5. Example `split("\\s+")` Split based on spaces.
### Parser
The parser interprets the tokens generated by the tokenizer and applies them to filter the list of reports. It processes key-value pairs and general tokens differently to efficiently filter reports based on the user's search criteria.
1. Divides tokens into key-value pairs and general tokens for specialized processing.
2. Key-Value Processing: Filters reports by matching the specified key with the corresponding attribute in each report.
   Compares the value in the key-value pair with the attribute's value in the report.
3. General Token Processing: Checks multiple attributes (e.g., description, location, category, priority, user) for the presence of the token.
4. Apply Key-Value Filters: For each key-value pair, the parser filters the list of reports to include only those where the report's attribute matches the specified value.
   For example, a key-value pair location:main would filter reports where the location contains "main".
5. Apply General Token Filters: For each general token, the parser further filters the reports to include those where any relevant attribute contains the token.
   This allows for a broader search, capturing reports that may not be filtered by key-value pairs alone.
6. Example: use input -> `"location:Main St#$@.. priority:high pothole."`  
   tokens -> `"location:main", "st", "priority:high", "pothole"`  
   Key-Value Tokens : `"location:main", "priority:high"`  
   General Tokens: `"st", "pothole"`  
   result: reports in which location is main and priority is high, and also contain "st' and "pothole".

### Others

A feature we would like to highlight that we implemented was forming a
foundational activity - [BaseActivity](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/f6a52c64a740d49233e09fb4476b1a96d191f5c8/app/src/main/java/com/example/prototype/util/BaseActivity.java) which acts as an Interface for all
the other activities for the application. It lays out the inheriting
activity as a child view and displays the foundation as the primary
content.
This also integrates a central navigation system which allows for
accesibility to other activities.

The purpose of this feature was to have a standard design for every
page of the application and increase code reusability. It prevented
us from having to add buttons in every activity for navigation and
also made the UI interface uniform in terms of Layout.

## Implemented Features
*[What features have you implemented? where, how, and why?]* <br>
*List all features you have completed in their separate categories with their featureId. THe features must be one of the basic/custom features, or an approved feature from Voice Four Feature.*

### Basic Features
1. [LogIn]. Description of the feature ... (easy)
   * Code: [Class X, methods Z, Y](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2100/group-project/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/items/media/_examples/Dummy.java#L22-43) and Class Y, ...
   * Description of feature: ... <br>
   * Description of your implementation: ... <br>

2. [DataFiles]. Description of the feature ... (easy)
   * Code to the Data File [reports_dataset.json](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/4211a2b73d3609ae153915b5ea24e70b69bb785c/report_dataset_generator/generate_reports.py).
   * Description of feature: Our dataset is stored in a json file in the folder report_dataset_generator. This feature is intended to have a dataset consisting of 2500 instances of our primary data which is reports. A comprehensive dataset of this size and variety allows for robust and accurate testing of the core functionalities in our application (Such as Searching, Sorting and Data Visualisation). It simulates a real-world scenario wherin an app will have a diverse variety of user-inputs and should be able to handle large volues of data efficiently. <br>
   * Description of our implementation: We used a python script to create 2500 instances of report which are our main data files. It uses the random function to generate reports from pre-defined data pools for fields - location, category, priority, users, date, time and likes to ensure a large diversity in the dataset. For each report, a unique integer id is attached. Each report is saved as a dictionary and added to a list, which is ultimately serialised into a formatted JSON file reports_dataset.json. <br>
   
3. [LoadShowData]. Description of the feature ... (easy) 
    * Code: [Class MainActivity, method loadData()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/prototype/util/JsonDeserialiser.java?ref_type=heads)
    * Code: [Class ReportAdapter, method getView()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/prototype/util/JsonDeserialiser.java?ref_type=heads)
    * Code: [Class AVLTree, the entire file](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/prototype/util/JsonDeserialiser.java?ref_type=heads)
    * Code: [Class JsonDeserialiser, the entire file](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/prototype/util/JsonDeserialiser.java?ref_type=heads)
    * Description of feature: The AVLTree loads data from json file, converting them into Reports class and store them on the AVLTree, the dashboard displays reports instances onto the dashboard in scrolling order, with each report instance containg all the information about the report.
    * Description of your implementation: The loadData method reads data from json file in the assets folder and convert into a list of reports. The AVLTree add the reports onto itself, with reportId as its key, and Report class instance as the value. To show the data onto the dashboard, a customized array adapter is used to show the reports onto the dashboard, with relevant information dsiplayed nicely.<br>
4. [DataStream]. Description of the feature ... (medium)
   * Code: [Class MainActivity, methods startStreamThread, stopStreamThread, onStart, onStop](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/prototype/report/MainActivity.java?ref_type=heads) 
   * Description of feature: This feature allows the app to automatically add new report instances to the dashboard and store them in the AVL tree at specified time intervals, simulating the behavior of multiple users continuously submitting reports when encountering issues. The data stream process halts whenever the user navigates to another activity or performs a search.<br>
   * Description of your implementation: A single thread controls the data stream without relying on advanced Android threading techniques. The thread reads data from a JSON file, deserializes it into a list of report instances, and iterates through the list to add each report to the AVL tree for storage. The runOnUiThread method is used to reflect the changes on the dashboard in real time. After adding a report, the thread pauses for a specified interval using Thread.sleep(). If the user switches to another activity or performs a search, the streaming process halts. Upon returning to the main dashboard, the stream resumes from where it left off. The implementation properly handles Android lifecycle events, ensuring the stream starts or resumes when needed and stops appropriately when leaving the MainActivity or interacting with the search bar. <br>

5. [UXUI] Description of the feature ... (easy)
    * Code: [Layout XML-file : activity_main.xml](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/0dfa6e401f0e1e40998f356b148f66c09a1be5fb/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml), [Layout XML-file : activity_base.xml](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/0dfa6e401f0e1e40998f356b148f66c09a1be5fb/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_base.xml), [Layout XML-file : activity_login.xml](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/0dfa6e401f0e1e40998f356b148f66c09a1be5fb/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_login.xml)
   * Description of feature: To maintain a uniform and consistent design language throughout the application, we ensured that the colors, fonts, and UI element styles worked with each other in harmony and made the User visual experience pleasant and enjoyable.
      * Font Used : Poppins
      * Colour Scheme : Black and White (Minimalistic)
      * UI Element Style : IOS 17 Filled Icons <br>
   * Description of your implementation: Maintaining a consistent design language and structure throughout without creating huge duplicate amounts of code was a challenge to us in the start of the project. This challenge was overcome by deciding to implement a foundational activity page that would display other activities as secondary content within the layout screen. This was implemented in BaseActivity which serves as the primary content view whose properties are inherited by every other activity. It incorporates features for navigation to different pages of the app as well as a fixed standard layout window which ensures that the size of the displayed activity is the same every time without the need for explicit instruction. This helped us keep the design language consistent along with the usage of uniform UI features. <br>


6. [UI Feedback]. Description of the feature ... (easy)
    * Code: [Class BaseActivity, method onCreate](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/b98c45c8d17d8fefb6b2c1463ec23ecb1082342f/app/src/main/java/com/example/prototype/util/BaseActivity.java)
    * Code: [Class ReportActivity, method onCreate](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/b98c45c8d17d8fefb6b2c1463ec23ecb1082342f/app/src/main/java/com/example/prototype/report/ReportActivity.java) 
    * Code: [Class ReportAdapter, method getView](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/b98c45c8d17d8fefb6b2c1463ec23ecb1082342f/app/src/main/java/com/example/prototype/report/ReportAdapter.java)
    * Code: [Class MainActivity, method onCreate](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/b98c45c8d17d8fefb6b2c1463ec23ecb1082342f/app/src/main/java/com/example/prototype/report/MainActivity.java)
    * Description of feature: This feature provides instant feedback to the user while interacting within the appâ€”whether clicking various activities, and options, liking/unliking reports, adding reports, or deleting them. The BaseActivity has toast notifications that provide feedback confirming the user's interaction with navigation buttons such as a dashboard or charts has been received. The ReportActivity displays toast messages from dropdowns about the user's selection of categories and priorities. Also, when they submit a report, a toast notification appears upon successfully submitting a report. ReportAdapter has a changing heart icon as soon as the user likes/dislikes a report. A confirmation dialog also appears when deleting a report, giving users the option to delete it immediately or schedule the deletion. Whenever a new report is added, the report list is immediately updated, and a toast from the MainActivity notifies the user.

   * Description of your implementation: The MPAndroid Chart library is used to display meaningful data graphically in our application. The graphical representation makes analyzing data more intuitive for users. It also makes it easier to deduce observations by the governing authority of this application and these observations can play a key role in forming future decisions that determine the operation of the intended smart city. To view these graphs, the user is able to navigate to the graphs section of the app from any page in the app using the dashboard. The graphs button on the dashboard routes the user to ChartActivity where the user has options of reports to choose from. The implementation consists of 3 different types of graphs displaying important information that portray the trends in report filing based on Priority, Location and Category.
   
    
      - Priority Bar Graph - Pressing the Priority Graph button routes the user to the PriorityChartActivity which implements a standard bar graph to display the amount of reports categorised by their priority - (High, Medium, Low). The activity page retrieves the data in the form of extra intent passed on by ChartActivity which utilises the method getPriorityCounts from ReportAnalyzer. This information is passed on as a HashMap which iterates through the input(reports) and counts the number of reports in each priority. This HashMap is then used to display the Bar Graph using the MPAndroidChart library with standard implementation. 
      - Category Pie Graph - Pressing the Category Graph button routes the user to the CategoryChartActivity which implements a standard pie graph to display the amount of reports categorised by their category - (Maintenance, Safety, Public, Utilities, Environmental, Community, Infrastructure). The activity page retrieves the data in the form of extra intent passed on by ChartActivity which utilises the method getCategoryCounts from ReportAnalyzer. This information is passed on as a HashMap which iterates through the input(reports) and counts the percentage of reports in each category. This HashMap is then used to display the Pie Chart using the MPAndroidChart library with standard implementation.
      - Location Radar Graph - Pressing the Location Graph button routes the user to the LocationChartActivity which implements a standard radar graph to display the amount of reports categorised by their location - (form sample data and newly added report locations). The activity page retrieves the data in the form of extra intent passed on by ChartActivity which utilises the method getLocationCounts from ReportAnalyzer. This information is passed on as a HashSet which iterates through the input(reports) and counts the number of reports in each unique location. This HashSet is then used to display the Radar Graph using the MPAndroidChart library with standard implementation.

   * Description of your implementation: I firstly wrote the code of removing an element from the AVLTree. Recursion is used here, with the use of helper recur method removeRec(). It breaks into 3 cases of removing, with the consideration of height update and tree rebalancing. Then in the ReportAdapter, If you click on the deletion button, the report get removed from the list of array adapter used for showing the report items, and then pass the reportId to the MainActivity to delete the report from the tree.  <br>

4. [Data-GPS]. Description of the feature  (easy)
   * Code: [Class ReportActivity, methods checkLocationPermissionAndSubmit, getLocationAnSubmitReport, onRequestPermissionResult](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7782612/gp-24s2/-/blob/2d09ad6910cb2804f4cf5dc737e07f647ba9898c/app/src/main/java/com/example/prototype/report/ReportActivity.java)
   * Description of your implementation: This feature automatically gets the user's location using the GPS when submitting the report, removing the need for manual entry. After getting the GPS coordinates, I then implemented a reverse geocoding process to convert the coordinates into a street address, which is included in the report submission. This feature improves the accuracy and ease of reporting, while also providing detailed location to the relevant authorities.

### Surprise Feature

<br> <hr>

1. Identifying a Code Component for Refactoring with a Design Pattern
   Before releasing the surprise feature, our group had already implemented two design patterns in the codebase. While reviewing my teammate's code, I found a code snippet using a switch statement to determine different sorting actions based on the position of the input. This component could benefit from being refactored using the Factory Design Pattern.

   The original code involved multiple conditional branches with a     switch statement, which made the code less flexible and harder to maintain as new sorting requirements emerged, which led to several issues:

   Lack of Extensibility: Whenever new sorting logic was introduced, we had to modify the existing switch statement, which violated the Open-Closed Principle.

   Complexity: The switch statement made the code less readable and harder to maintain as the number of conditional branches increased.

2. Correcting the Implementation Issues Identified

To resolve these issues, I refactored the code to use a Factory Design Pattern:

I defined a Functional Interface called Sorter  with a sort() method.

I implemented Different Sorters: Created different classes that implemented the Sorter interface, each providing a specific sorting method.

I then Built a Sorter Factory: Developed a SorterFactory class to generate appropriate Sorter instances based on the input position.

This new approach improved the robustness and maintainability of the sorting logic. Now, adding new sorting algorithms does not require modifying the existing factory but simply adding a new implementation of the Sorter interface.

    (Note: The sortReports method in MainActivity was refactored by my teammate - the original author after October 10 to enhance its readability. The version I worked on differs slightly from the original one I provided due to these improvements. However, due to project requirement, I am not permitted to provide any commits or code changes made after October 10.)

*[Write a well defined protocol your team can use to handle conflicts. That is, if your group has problems, what is the procedure for reaching consensus or solving a problem?
(If you choose to make this an external document, link to it here)]*

*If your group has issues, how will your group reach consensus or solve the problem?*
*- e.g., if a member gets sick, what is the solution? Alternatively, what is your plan to mitigate the impact of unforeseen incidents for this 6-to-8-week project?*

This shall include an agreed procedure for situations including (but not limited to):
- A member is sick in the final week of the project.
- A member didn't complete the assigned task which should've been completed before the checkpoint, and the checkpoint is approaching.
- A member is unreachable (didn't respond messages in your agreed communication channels and emails in two days).
- The team have different understandings toward the requirement of the assignment.
