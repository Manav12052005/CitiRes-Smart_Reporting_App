Conflict Resolution Protocol


--
Firstly, PREVENTION

By clearly assigning work to each  team-member of the group and outlining their expectations, we attempt to prevent any disagreements from occurring in the first place. It is the duty of every team member to communicate freely to prevent misunderstandings.
If conflicts do occur, they ought to be brought up right away during meetings.

2. Step-by-Step Resolution Process

Step 1: Have Direct One-on-One Talk

It is expected that the team members have a private, productive conversation to figure out a solution on their own(this is ideally he best solution).
Both sides should provide evidence to support their positions if the disagreement is about how work is divided, technical choice, or the functionality of the code (such as from meeting minutes, documentation, or coding rules).


Step 2: A team member or outsider mediates the conflict
The subject will be brought to the attention of a member (a neutral team member selected by both sides) only and only if a direct discussion fails to settle the issue.
After hearing all perspectives, the team member will arbitrate the conversation and offer a solution.

Step 3: Voting and Group Discussion
A team meeting will be called to discuss the conflict if it continues.
After giving each team member a chance to express their thoughts, they will vote to determine the best plan of action for resolving the situation.

The decision taken by the majority vote will be final and must be respected by all team members.

Step 3 is the final step and the decision taken here cannot be challenged so as to keep the work flow steady.

3. Record-keeping
   To maintain openness and a clear record for the future course of action, all conflicts must be explicitly stated in the meeting minutes.
   The settlement of conflicts may lead to important changes in job distribution or decision-making, which also need to be documented in the report.

4. Final Agreement
   All team members must abide by this agreement to maintain a  productive working environment.
