Conflict Resolution Protocol
--
1. Prevention
Each team member is responsible for maintaining clear and respectful communication to avoid misunderstandings.
All disagreements should be raised early in meetings, rather than letting them fester.


2. Step-by-Step Resolution Process

Step 1: Direct Discussion

The team members involved in the conflict will engage in a private, constructive discussion to resolve the issue.
If the conflict concerns work distribution or technical decisions, both parties should present their views with supporting evidence (e.g., from project minutes, documentation, or coding guidelines).


Step 2: Mediation by a Team Leader
If direct discussion does not resolve the issue, the matter will be brought to the attention of the team leader (or a neutral team member chosen by both parties).
The team leader will mediate a discussion and propose a solution after hearing both sides.


Step 3: Group Discussion and Voting
If the conflict persists, it will be discussed during a team meeting.
Each team member will have the opportunity to voice their opinion, after which a democratic vote will decide the course of action.
The decision made by the majority vote will be final and must be respected by all team members.

Step 4: Escalation to Instructor/Advisor

If the team cannot resolve the conflict internally after voting, the issue will be escalated to the course instructor or advisor for final resolution.
The instructorâ€™s decision will be binding.

3. Documentation
All conflicts and their resolutions will be documented in the project minutes to ensure transparency.
If any significant change in task allocation or decisions arises from the conflict resolution, this must be recorded in the report.

4. Final Agreement
All team members agree to follow this protocol to maintain a professional and productive working environment.
